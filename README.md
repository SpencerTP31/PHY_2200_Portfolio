### Introduction
This portfolio is my three favorite projects I did throughout my Computational Physics Course (PHY-2200) at High Point University. Throughout this class as a computer science major I was able to incorporate things I had learned throughout my computer science classes and use them to create physics models. The three projects I've decided to showcase are, Magnus Effect on a golf shot, the Rossler and Lorenz Model to dive deeper into Chaotic Behaviors, and lastly using Mel Spectograms in conjunction with AI to create a vowel classifier. The links below will bring you to a complete description of each in this README

## Magnus Effect

Creating ReadMe's for your Github repository can be tedious.  I hope this template can save you time and effort as well as provide you with some consistency across your projects.
