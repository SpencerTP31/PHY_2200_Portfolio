# Lorenz and Rossler Model
## By Spencer Peters

---
### Overview
In this project, I was modeling the Lorenz model to see at what point a chaotic behavior was found. While doing this I stumbled upon the Rossler model which is a single point attractor that also has a chaotic state. The big difference between these two models is the fact that the Lorenz model has two fixed points while the Rossler model only has one fixed point.
