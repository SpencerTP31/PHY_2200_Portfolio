# Magnus Effect
## By Spencer Peters

### Overview
In this project, I investigated the Magnus Effect on a golf ball during its flight. This was one of my most important discoveries during this class as I decided to go off the beaten path and research golf ball flights. I originally was going to model a figure that is shown in the book. When writing the code for this figure I kept getting a slightly different result which leads me to investigate and realize the author had not provided us with his air density and air resistance leading me to infer those.
